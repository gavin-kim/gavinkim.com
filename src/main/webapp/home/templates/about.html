      Hello I'm Yoonkwan Kim, a software developer currently living in Toronto.
      I'm passionate about new technologies and I get a lot of enjoyment out of
      learning them. Developing new things is very exciting and brings me great
      happiness. This website is for my portfolio and developing recreational
      applications using AngularJS and Spring.
